# Lab 8 - Starter
1. I would fit my automated tests for my project within a GitHub actions that runs whenever code is pushed. This allows me to ensure that the code that is written is always in a working state before it is pushed into production. 
2. No, I would not use an end-to-end test to check if a function is returning the correct output, because an end-to-end test would test the entire application from start to finish. Rather, to test the functionality of a function, I would use a unit test.
